Combine the functionality of the Week 4 script: testOpenCSVfile.py
With the functionality of the Week 5 script: ListFilesFromDirectoryAndSubdirectories.py
to create a script that when run will
-- allow you to click on a directory
-- it will then make a list of all the *.csv files in that directory
-- it will then sequentially open each of those files and read the columns into a list
-- it will then average each column and print the average and the filename to the screen 
   before moving on to the next file
